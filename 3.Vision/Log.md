Today's Progress: Getting Started again with Linear Algebra, this was amazing and Andrew Ng is an amazing teacher, I have some lecture notes in the directory

Thoughts: It was amazing, every concept was really matching with how dataset will be and it was a great experience working every operation out in Python/R/Octave.
